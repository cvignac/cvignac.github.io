I am a researcher at [Isomorphic Labs](https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/), working on generative models for therapeutics design. 
I hold a PhD from EPFL (2023), where I studied under the guidance of Pascal Frossard and developed several denoising diffusion models for molecules and graphs in general.
Before that, I studied in France at Ã‰cole Polytechnique and ENS Paris-Saclay (master MVA - Mathematics, Vision and Learning).
